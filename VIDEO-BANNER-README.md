## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Video
1. Create or obtain a 5-second video for your banner
2. Compress the video to reduce file size (recommended: under 2MB)
3. Convert to both MP4 and WebM formats for best compatibility
4. Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or 1920x600

### Step 2: Upload to Shopify
1. Go to your Shopify Admin
2. Navigate to `Settings` → `Files`
3. Upload your video files
4. Copy the video URL

### Step 3: Update the HTML
Replace the video source in the code:
```html
<source src="YOUR_VIDEO_URL.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<source src="YOUR_VIDEO_URL.webm" type="video/webm">
```

### Step 4: Customize
- Update the overlay text to match your brand
- Modify colors and fonts in the CSS
- Adjust the CTA button text and link
- Change the poster image for the loading state

## Troubleshooting
